# Development of Quality on Demand APIs

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Make sure Maven 3 or greater and JDK 17 are installed on your system.

### How to run locally

Please ensure, that the prerequisites are fulfilled.
To run a QoD API locally, you have to follow these steps:

* Build
* Create Database
* Start QoD API

#### Build

Build the project by running ```mvn clean package```

#### Create Redis-Database (optional)

The creation of a Redis-Database is only needed if you use another profile than **'local'**.
Otherwise, QoD API will use an in-memory H2-database.

If a profile is used different to **'local'**, the QoD API needs a Redis database to persist the session data.
Therefore, you can use a local instance of Redis DB or start Redis from Docker container:

* start Redis from Docker container by running ```docker run --name qos-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis```
* local instance on Windows: https://github.com/zkteco-home/redis-windows
* local instance on Linux: https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/

#### Start QoD API

For information about how to configure the QoD API, please refer to the next section "Configuration".

Start the qod-api service from terminal or from an IDE or with docker

* from
  terminal:```java --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar core\target\senf-core-<current version>.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local```
* from an IDE: Application can also be started directly from an IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc. by passing VM
  options in the "Run Configuration":
    * --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED
    * -Dspring.profiles.active=local
* with docker:
    * ```docker build -t qod-api . ```
    * ```docker run -dp 9091:9091 -p 9092:9092 qod-api```

With the 'local'-profile the application will automatically connect to an in-memory H2-database.

## Configuration

The configuration can be adapted here: core/src/main/resources/application.yml

The below table lists the environment variables that are used to configure the application properly. This reference
implementation for the QoD API makes use of the AsSessionWithQoS API (https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/latest/Rel-17)
which is usually made available as a part of a NEF/SCEF system. All variables in the below table starting with "SCEF"
can be understood as NEF/SCEF.
