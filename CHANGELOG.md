# v0.10.0-rc

**This is the release candidate of v0.10.0 - containing the upcoming fourth alpha version of the Quality-On-Demand (QoD) API**

- API definition **with inline documentation**:
    - OpenAPI [YAML spec file](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/release-0.10.0-rc/code/API_definitions/qod-api.yaml)
    - [View it on ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/release-0.10.0-rc/code/API_definitions/qod-api.yaml&nocors)

## Please note:

- **This release will contain significant changes compared to v0.9.0, and it is not backward compatible**
    - Within notifications the schema `EventNotification`has been replace by `CloudEvent` in accordance with the updated CAMARA Design
      Guidelines
    - If within `device` an IPv6 address is used it must be a single IPv6 address (out of the prefix used by the device)
- **This is only the pre-release, it should be considered as a draft of the upcoming release v0.10.0**
    - The pre-release is meant for implementors, but it is not recommended to use the API with customers in productive environments.

### Main Changes

* Aligned event notification with CloudEvent spec which will allow API consumers and implementators to use standard libraries and tools
  which are available to handle CloudEvents (https://cloudevents.io/)
* Added a new operation `/sessions/{sessionId}/extend` which allows to extend the duration of an active session

### Added

* Added new endpoint to extend duration of an active session by @emil-cheung in https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216

  in https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/233

# v0.1.0 - Initial contribution

**Initial contribution of two API definitions for Quality on Demand (stable bandwidth and stable latency)**, including initial documentation
and implementation code.

## Please note

- this "release" is only tagged to document the history of the API, it is not intended to be used by implementors or API customers
- it was implemented by Deutsche Telekom within lab environment and tested against two NEF implementations
- going forward the
  implementation [code](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/50e81e0c4a6a7431c0a7f50c26415caf935be6df/code/API_code) will
  not be part of releases of QoD API. Instead it will be provided within separate repositories (QualityOnDemand_PIx).
