### quality-on-demand v0.11.0

#### Added
- device can also be provided inside the access-token. The provider will extract the corresponding claims to use them for the following flows.
- If a device is given via accessToken and request-body, then an additional match-validation is triggered. This will verify that, e.g., the phoneNumber  of the access-token matches the one of the request-body If there is a mismatch, the provider will answer with HTTP-403 INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT
- If there is no device provided by access-token or request-body then the provider will return with HTTP-422 UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE
- If the provided device-identifier is not supported by the provider implementation, the provider will return with HTTP-422 UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE_IDENTIFIERS
- New endpoint for retrieving all sessions for a specific device retrieveSessions

#### Changed
- Sessions can only be extended when they are in state `AVAILABLE`
- Sessions start when they get `AVAILABLE` otherwise they stay in the status `REQUESTED` with a duration of one day (86400 seconds).
